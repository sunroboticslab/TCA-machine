# Twisted and Coiled Actuator (TCA) Machine - Versions 1 & 2

Welcome to the Twisted and Coiled Actuator (TCA) Machine project repository! This project involves the design, manufacturing, and development of two versions of a machine used to fabricate TCAs for soft robotic applications. TCAs mimic biological actuators and are ideal for creating compliant, adaptive, and resilient robots. This repository contains the models, control software, documentation, and more for both versions of the TCA machine.

## Project Overview

The TCA Machine is an automated fabrication system designed to create free stroke twisted and coiled actuators for use in soft robotic systems. These actuators provide high contraction ratios and are useful for many robotic applications, such as actuating tensegrity robots and shape-morphing quadrupedal robots.

There are two versions of the TCA machine available in this repository:

- **Version 1**: The initial prototype that introduces the concept of automating TCA production, featuring a simpler mechanical and electrical setup.
- **Version 2**: An enhanced version that includes mechanical improvements, control box redesign, improved user manuals, and additional optimizations for efficient production.
